# Developing-Data-Products

In this course project, a shiny app is made to predict horsepower and displacement from miles per galon. The data set is obtained from mtcars in Rstudio. A linear model is fitted between the two features. Based on the linear model, the user input which is the miles per galon will be used to predict the potential values for displacement as well as horsepower. The results are completely based on the dataset. The user also has the option to show the plots as well as the points on the plots by using the checkboxes. This allows the user to select the number of fitted lines as they see fit.
